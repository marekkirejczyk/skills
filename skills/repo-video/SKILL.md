description: Make a narrated explainer video of a repository or a pull request, as an MP4 with captions on a shareable video page. Scenes reveal and highlight item by item while a synthetic voice explains them (macOS say by default; OpenAI or ElevenLabs when configured). Use only when the user asks for a narrated video, screencast or video explainer of a repository, a feature or a pull request.

# /repo-video

Make a video that explains code to a developer: the sister of `repo-presentation`, with a voice instead of a presenter. Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`. If your agent does not fill that in, take the arguments from the user's message.

- **Repo mode** (default): introduce the repository to a developer new to it, organised around its **features**: each feature on screen, then how it works underneath, then the code.
- **PR mode**: the arguments start with `pr` (`pr 123`, `pr <url>`, `pr <branch>`, or `pr` alone for the current branch). Walk a reviewer through one pull request, organised around its **changes**.

The remaining arguments give the language of the narration and captions (default: the language the user writes in; pick a voice that speaks it) and optionally an audience or focus.

`<skill-dir>` is the folder holding this file. `<project>` is the video's working folder, outside the repository: `<scratchpad>/video` when your agent has a scratchpad, else `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/repo-video-<repo>`. Nothing goes into the repository unless the user asks.

## 1. Survey

Read `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` and the README first, and obey their restrictions (for example: never run the app against production data).

- **Repo mode:** collect what the product does and its invariants, the runtime components, the package map, the data model, 4–8 user-visible features with their main flow and key files, and how it's tested and deployed. Delegate the broad reading to one or two subagents when your agent has them.
- **PR mode:** `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,headRefOid,baseRefName,files,commits`, then a worktree of the PR head in `<project>/head` (`git fetch origin pull/<n>/head` and `git worktree add --detach`). A branch with no PR (or `pr` alone, for the current branch) is compared with the merge base of the default branch. Read the whole diff against the merge base. Collect each change, its why (from the description and commits), and what the PR claims as evidence.

Every file path, type, snippet and number in the video must exist on the commit being explained. Snippets may be shortened with `…` but keep the real order of steps.

## 2. Outline: show the user before building

A table of scenes: id, chapter title, one line of what it shows, the number of steps, and an estimated length (narration words ÷ 150 per minute). Default arc:

- **PR mode** (3–6 minutes): what the PR does in one idea; the concepts a reviewer needs first (a new format, the existing behaviour it builds on); each change (what it is, the code); evidence; what to look at in review.
- **Repo mode** (6–12 minutes): what it is; architecture; data model; each feature (screen, flow, code); testing and deployment; where to start reading.

Wait for the user's go-ahead or changes.

## 3. Evidence: run the code

What the video shows as output comes from running the code of the commit being explained: tests, the CLI, the app. No mockups and no screenshots from the docs or production. Save outputs to `<project>/evidence/` as you go. Screenshots of a UI go in `<project>/shots/` (Playwright, 1920×1080); look at each one before using it. If the code can't run (secrets, paid APIs), ask the user how to proceed.

## 4. Write the scenes and the script

Read `reference/scene-format.md` now. `assets/example/` is a complete four-scene project to start from: a video about this skill, with a cover, a diagram, a code panel and terminal output.

- `<project>/script.json`: title, voice, lexicon, and the scenes in order, each with its narration steps.
- `<project>/scenes/<id>.html`: one 1920×1080 scene per file, its items marked with `data-step` (appears and is emphasised at that step) and `data-focus` (emphasised again later).

**Narration** is what the viewer hears while step k is on screen, so each step's sentence talks about exactly the item that appears or lights up at k. Write for the ear:

- One idea per step, one to three sentences, each under 25 words. Plain spoken English, contractions welcome.
- Say what the screen shows and why it matters; never read code aloud character by character.
- Write numbers and names as they should be heard in the narration, or teach the voice through `lexicon` (`"JSON": "jason"`, `"PR": "P R"`, a login → the person's name). Captions show the narration as written, so keep it readable as text too.

## 5. Build

Once per project: `cd <project> && npm init -y && npm i playwright-core`. Chromium comes from `$CHROME` or the Playwright cache (`npx playwright install chromium` if neither has one); `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` must be on the PATH, and Node 18 or newer. Off macOS there is no `say`: configure `openai` or `elevenlabs` (see Voice).

Run from `<project>`: `node <skill-dir>/scripts/make.mjs . all`. It synthesises the narration (cached per sentence and voice), records every step's animation in Chromium, joins the segments with the narration into `out/video.mp4` with captions, and writes the video page into `out/page/`. After an edit, run `all` again; `--scene <id>` with `render` re-records one scene.

The build is done when:

- it prints no `WARN` line (an out-of-range step, a step that shows nothing, content running off the frame or out of its box, a failed image);
- you have looked at `out/preview/<scene>-<step>.png` for every scene's last step and every step that adds code or a diagram, and nothing is clipped, overlapping or unreadable;
- the printed length is within the outline's estimate, and the file is under 20 MB (else raise `-crf` in `assemble.mjs` or shorten).

## 6. Publish the video page

- **With an artifact tool** (Claude Code, claude.ai): read its page rules first (the artifact server's `guide`, topic `pages`). Publish `out/page/` as a multi-file artifact: `index.html` and `video.mp4` at those paths (the captions are inside the page; the host serves no `.vtt`), a title (the video's, two to four words) and icon `video`. Republish to the same artifact after changes.
- **Without one** (Codex, Antigravity, …): hand over `out/page/`, whose `index.html` plays `video.mp4` beside it when opened in a browser, and `out/video.mp4` on its own, with `out/captions.srt`.

## 7. Hand-off

Reply with the page link (or the paths); the length and chapter list; the commit the evidence was run on; the voice used; what was shortened or left out; and any doc–code mismatch you found. Remove PR worktrees you added. Commit nothing.

## Voice

`script.json` `voice` picks the narrator; the environment variables `VIDEO_TTS_PROVIDER` and `VIDEO_TTS_VOICE` override it for one run.

| provider | `name` | other keys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `say` (default, macOS) | a voice from `say -v '?'`; default: the best installed of Ava, Zoe, Evan, Jamie (Premium, then Enhanced), Samantha, Daniel | `rate` (words a minute, default 175) |
| `openai` | a voice, default `alloy` | `model` (default `gpt-4o-mini-tts`), `instructions` (tone) |
| `elevenlabs` | required: a voice name as the account's voice list shows it (`Matilda`) or its id | `model` (default `eleven_multilingual_v2`) |

An API key is read, first found wins, from `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, then the macOS Keychain item `repo-video-openai` / `repo-video-elevenlabs`, then `~/.config/repo-video/openai.key` / `elevenlabs.key`. Never print a key, write it into the project, or ask for it in chat; the user stores it, for example with `security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s repo-video-elevenlabs -U -w`.

The Premium and Enhanced macOS voices sound far better than the defaults and are free: System Settings › Accessibility › Spoken Content › System voice › Manage Voices. When only a default voice is installed, say so in the hand-off. A paid provider sends the narration text to that company and spends the account's credits: use one only when the user configured it, and use only a voice the account owns or a stock one, never one that imitates a real person.
